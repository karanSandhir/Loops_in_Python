# Loops_in_Python
A collection of Python programs focusing on loops (for &amp; while).   Includes basic to intermediate problems like number sequences, tables, sums, and pattern printing.   This repository is part of my journey to strengthen Python fundamentals before moving into Data Structures, AI &amp; ML.  
# Python Loops Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains practice problems using **loops in Python** (`for` and `while`).  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in control flow and problem-solving before moving into advanced topics like Data Structures, Algorithms, and eventually AI/ML.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `numbers_1_to_20.py` â†’ Print numbers from 1 to 20  
- `table_of_7.py` â†’ Print multiplication table of 7  
- `sum_1_to_100.py` â†’ Find the sum of numbers 1 to 100  
- `star_pattern.py` â†’ Print a simple star pattern  

## âœ¨ Why this repo?
This is part of my **Python learning journey**.  
Every solved problem here represents a step towards becoming an **AI/ML & Software Engineer**.
